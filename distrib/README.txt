How do you compile your code? Provide instructions for Athena Linux. You will not need to provide
instructions on how to run your code, because it must run with the exact command line given earlier
in this document.

To compile on Athena Linux, type "make" in the "distrib" directory.

Did you collaborate with anyone in the class? If so, let us know who you talked to and what sort of
help you gave or received.

I talked with Leah Alpert and Chase Lambert about high-level math concepts related to the problem set.

Were there any references (books, papers, websites, etc.) that you found particularly helpful for
completing your assignment? Please provide a list.

The lecture notes were very useful. 

Are there any known problems with your code? If so, please provide a list and, if possible, describe
what you think the cause is and how you might fix them if you had more time or motivation. This
is very important, as we’re much more likely to assign partial credit if you help us understand what’s
going on.

Not as far as I know. The only slight cosmetic difference between my answer and the solution is that my textures are slightly brighter. This could be because of my choice in using diffuseColor. 

Did you do any of the extra credit? If so, let us know how to use the additional features. If there was
a substantial amount of work involved, describe what how you did it.

No.

Got any comments about this assignment that you’d like to share?

No.
